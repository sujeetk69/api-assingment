# Sample Test scenarios to test APIs https://restful-api.dev/ 

## Summary
I have added some positive, some negative and couple of edge case.
I have mainly used 
- **RestAssured**: to make API calls
- **JsonPath**: for validations
- **TestNG**: As test runner
- **Cucumber**: BDD framework
- **log4j**: For general purpose logging
- **Gradle**: as the build tool
- **IntelliJ Idea**: IDE


## Logs
Log file `api-test.log` will be created (appended) at `log/`
I have deliberately added my log file to the repository to be seen

## Report
An HTML report `cucumber-reports.html` will be created after each run at `target/`. 
I also added this to the repository.
